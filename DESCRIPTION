Description: Keeps a table of the R-Packages in NVIverse. The table includes also
    meta data for the packages. The information is used in all NVIverse packages 
    when generating vignettes and in 'NVIbatch' in functions that use a list of
    NVIverse packages. This table is keept in a separate package to avoid circular
    dependencies between packages in NVIverse.
