Description: Keeps a table of the R packages in `NVIverse`. The table includes also
    meta data for the packages. The information is used in all NVIverse packages 
    when generating vignettes and in the package 'NVIbatch' in functions that use 
    a list of NVIverse packages. This table is kept in a separate package to avoid 
    circular dependencies between packages within NVIverse.
